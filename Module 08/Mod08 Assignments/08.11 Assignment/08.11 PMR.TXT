<+s>: This assignment went well and smooth because it was pretty easy.
      Learning about the ArrayLists was like learning about arrays (with
      some extra steps). The background information greatly helped. 

<-s>: It took me a while to understand what this assignment was asking,
      partly because I was overthinking the calculations. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, I need to keep up with the pace since the deadline is
nearing (few weeks). I also need to stop overthinking the problems and
apply previous lessons into the assignments.
