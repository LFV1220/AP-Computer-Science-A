PROJECT TITLE: 16.05 Challenge Program
VERSION or DATE: 3/18/20
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

For this assignment, employ all the standard algorithm methods. You will 
be making a grade book program similar to one an instructor might use. 
The grade book will include students and their grades. The program will 
traverse, replace, insert, and delete items within the grade book.

<+s>: This feels like it was the easiest challenge program is the segment,
      and maybe even in the course. I understood the algorithms and enjoyed
      doing this assignment.

<-s>: The hardest part of this assignment was deciding how I wanted to
      approach this assignment as well as remembering the algorithms,
      which wasn't hard at all.
