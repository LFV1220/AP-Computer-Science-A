PROJECT TITLE: 06.02 Weather Data
VERSION or DATE: 10/10/19
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Write a program that displays the average temperature and the annual 
precipitation for a selected city. The user should be able to choose 
whether temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit or Celsius and whether 
precipitation is displayed in inches or centimeters.

<+s>: Making this program was almost a breeze. The arrays were easy to
      comprehend and understand and breaking it up into two parts made 
      it alot more easier (6.1 and 6.2). I understood how to structure 
      the code pretty quickly and I rarely had bugs.
      
<-s>: Some of the bugs I had was the formatting with the printf(), since
      I wasn't using the correct letter (like d for ints and f for 
      doubles). It took me a little while to figure out how to format the
      ending printf() statements because it took me a bit to understand
      how to format using the printf(). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, I have to keep practicing the syntax of the printf()
statements (since they are a little weird). I can get plenty of 
practice with them if I keep using them instead of the print() and
println().
