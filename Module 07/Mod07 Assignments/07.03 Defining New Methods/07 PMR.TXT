PROJECT TITLE: 07.03-07.04 Defining New Methods
VERSION or DATE: 10/29/19
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Write a program to determine the surface gravity (g) on each planet in
our solar system. (The results of this assignment will be used in later
lessons, but will not be submitted for a grade at this time.)

<+s>: This wasn't too difficult although rather confusing, with the 
      introduction of static methods. When I broke it up into small pieces
      (like a puzzle) it was so much easier to do and somewhat understand.

<-s>: I was a little bit confused with this assignment but looked over the
      eIMACS lesson. Some minor mistakes that came with confusion, which
      were easily fixed later on (like realizing the read file was for the
      next assignment). A major problem that I had was with the calculations 
      for getting the weights (on the 07.04) assignment. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, I need to start planning and making more pseudocode because
this is starting to get confusing because its like a web or a map, and its
easy to get lost. I also need to practice my problem solving using sites
like codingbat.
