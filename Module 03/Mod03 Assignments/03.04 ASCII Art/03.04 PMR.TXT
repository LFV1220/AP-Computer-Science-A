PROJECT TITLE: 03.04 ASCII Art 
VERSION or DATE: 8/11/19
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

In this assignment (03.04 ASCII Art), I created a star 
using asterisks, string literals, print() method, and 
escape sequences. 

********************* P M R ****************************
<+s>: One of the easier parts of the assignment wasknowing
      how to use the string literal and how to correctly
      place the asterisks (from previous lessons).
      
<-s>: One thing that confused me while making the ASCII
      Art was when I could only use the print() method 
      (not the println() method) with escape sequences.
      It took me a little to find out how to use it in 
      this instance, since I had to look back at the 
      lessons. 
********************************************************
 
In the future, I will keep learning as much as I can and 
get as much practice as I can. This will greatly help with
confusions in the future when I don't know how to continue.
