PROJECT TITLE: 07.01 Java's Math Class
VERSION or DATE: 10/26/19
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Write a program to calculate the (x, y) coordinates of points on a 
circle of a given radius.

----------------------------- P M R ------------------------------------
<+s>: This was a relatively simple assignment, thanks to the Math Class
      syntax in being easy to understand and comprehend. It was also a
      pretty short program (not too much code).

<-s>: There were some things that took me a while to do. It took me a
      little bit to understand the calculations, including how to code
      it. And I still don't have the hang of the printf() so it takes 
      me alittle bit to use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, my goal is to try my hardest to submit 1 assignment each
day or atleast 5 assignments each week. The reasons I got so behind in 
the first place, was because of a big project I had for a class and me
being stuck in the module 6 challenge program. I waited for the live
lesson because I wanted to understand the material more.
