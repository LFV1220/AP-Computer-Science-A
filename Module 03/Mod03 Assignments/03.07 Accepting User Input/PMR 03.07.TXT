PROJECT TITLE: 03.07 Accepting User Input Assignment
VERSION or DATE: 8/14/19
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

In this assignment, I changed GradesV2 (from a previous project) to
GradesV3 by updating the program by adding/using different methods 
of a Scanner class.

******************************* P M R ************************************

<+s>: The more I used the Scanner class, I am slowing starting to understand
      it way more. Also the pattern was easy to continue because of the last
      assignment.


<-s>: The different methods for the Scanner class can get a little tricky
      and one of the biggest challenges was formatting everything to look
      as user-friendly and what to do with the Scanners.  
     
**************************************************************************

In the future, in order to grasp new concepts and new methods/classes, I 
I personally find it very useful to not only read the material, but to
continuosly practice the new material and concepts.
