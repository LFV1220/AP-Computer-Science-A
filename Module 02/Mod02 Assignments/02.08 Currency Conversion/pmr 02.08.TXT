PROJECT TITLE: 02.08 Challenge Program Assignment
VERSION or DATE: 8/3/19

********************************** P M R ***************************************
<+s>: After the beginning, I was quickly able to understand what the assignment
      was asking and was able to complete most of the assignment. I used many
      arithmetic operators.

<-s>: Near the beginning, it took me a while to get me going and understand what
      the assignment was asking (hence the challenge). Another part of the
      assignment that confused me was the last/end part (with the souvenir
      purchases). I didn't really understand what I was supposed to do there, so 
      I completed the code by (without changing the variables) adding other lines
      of code using arithmetic operations to get the near the expected output. 
********************************************************************************

This program was about converting currencies and using exchange rates to find out
how much is being spent in a supposed vacation(s). 

In the future, I will continue to do my best in completing the program and what is 
required in the assignment and if I can't figure it out I wont hesitate to ask questions.  

For Instruction #6, both A (Bank of America) and B (ExchangeRate) were used in the
program.

ExchangeRate:       http://www.exchangerate.com/
