PROJECT TITLE: 08.09 Assignment
VERSION or DATE: 11/19/19
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Using a program that calculates the amount of carbon dioxide emitted 
for each gallon of gas consumed by a car, insert Javadoc comments where
appropriate.

----------------------------- P M R --------------------------------------
<+s>: The Javadoc assignment was easy to understand, since it is based
      on determining whether a method is a getter, mutator, or 
      constructor. 

<-s>: There were no difficulties in this assignment (since the Javadoc
      is very easy to comprehend), but I did have to reference back to
      the ShapesV9 quite a bit in order to grasp how it was to be
      formatted. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, I will incorporate the java docs into my assignments
moving forward because it helps one understand more of what is going on
within the code.
