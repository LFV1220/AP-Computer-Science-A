PROJECT TITLE: 15.01 Abstract Classes
VERSION or DATE: 3/5/20
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

For this assignment, create an abstract class for a homework reading 
assignment. Then create classes for courses so you can keep track of 
the homework assignment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<+s>: This assignment was fairly easy and straightforward, especially
      understanding the abstract class' makeup. 

<-s>: Using all the other classes and implementing them with the abstract
      class and the ArrayList was the hardest part and took me a little
      bit to figure out.
