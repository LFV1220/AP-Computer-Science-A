PROJECT TITLE: 14.07 Assignment
VERSION or DATE: 3/4/20
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Write a program to perform a frequency analysis of the letters in a 
message and use the results to decipher a secret message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<+s>: Figuring out the proper way to utilize OOP and the methods were 
      the easier parts of the assignment.

<-s>: There were many difficulties in this assignment/program. A minor 
      mistake that took me a while to figure out was when calculating the
      percentages, trying to use int instead of double. I also wasn't 
      able to format it well since I couldn't figure out how to use
      the PrintWriter print function. And I couldn't figure out the 
      message because I am trying to work/finish assignments quickly 
      since I fell that I am running out of time in this segment.
