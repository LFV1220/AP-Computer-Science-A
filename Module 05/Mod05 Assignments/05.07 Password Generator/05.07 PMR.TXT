AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Write a program to generate random passwords; the user should be able 
to select the character set and the length.

<+s>: This was suprisingly easy and quick for me to finish, I wasn't 
      expecting it to be simple (albeit a little bit of repetition). I
      enjoyed making this program because, not only was it satisfying 
      getting the wanted results, but since it gave me more confidence
      in programming in java. 

<-s>: There weren't many issues I ran into, and if I did they were quick
      patches. A few of the issues I encountered was an infinite loop of
      the password not being long enough and making userChoice quit when
      it equals 5.

In the future, I will try to get myself caught up (few weeks behind).
