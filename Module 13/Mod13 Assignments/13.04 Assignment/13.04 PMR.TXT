PROJECT TITLE: 13.04 Overriding Methods Assignment
VERSION or DATE: 2/07/20
AUTHORS: Luis Vega

Modify the shape classes override the toString and equals methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<+s>: Although this assignment was a little difficult, I was able to
      figure out how to get through some of the issues. For example, I 
      was able to cast some of the classes in order to fix the equals
      method. Some of the easier aspects of the assignment was creating 
      the methods, like the toString method, in the classes.

<-s>: Like said before, I thought this assignment was a little difficult.
      This is because I had some issues with the classes and the equals
      method and finding a way to accurately compare the shapes (at the
      end) through different classes.
