********************************** P M R ***********************************
<+s>: Learned some proper syntax when using print() and println(). 


<-s>: There was some frustration with the syntax because of some typos
      and getting used to it (Swift was a little different and was 
      throwing me off).
*****************************************************************************

In the future, I will keep reading the lessons and documentations and make
sure I don't make typos in the syntax. I will also make sure to continue when
I'm sure I understand everything in the lesson.
