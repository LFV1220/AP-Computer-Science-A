********************************** P M R ****************************************
<+s>: Im starting to feel some level of confort using BlueJ (it really does help
      simplify coding for me) and I am starting to get the hang of using correct
      syntax and how the operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing,
      and modulus operations) work in Java. 

<-s>: Had a little bit of trouble with starting the assignment and reworking the
      source code (although it does help build good habits).

*********************************************************************************

In the future, I can work on typing more proficiently (instead of quickly), finding
and reading lines to proof read, and keep working and practicing Java so I can get
a better understanding of it.
